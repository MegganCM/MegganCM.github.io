		<h1> About Me </h2>
			<img src="images/MegganCM_internship.jpg"

				<p> Hello! My name is Meggan and I am an Ecuadorian-American Artist. My current career goals involve following illustration and graphic design. My grand goal is to one day be able to be part of a production for an animated series and to make my own graphic novel series with my character designs. I like to use my art as a vehicle to tell stories that explore various aspects of our humanity whether it be the beauty of it or the monstrosities that are underneath the facades we live through from day to day. I love to draw what I see and take direct inspirations from all aspects of life. I often find myself using different fragments of my Ecuadorian-American culture where I can because im inspired to share my culture with others. Using digital art, painting, drawing, and animation, I attempt to reimagine my own stories through using bright colors and bold characters.</p>
