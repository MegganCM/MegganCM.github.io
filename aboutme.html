      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <p>
        Hello! My name is Meggan and I am an Ecuadorian-American Artist. My
        current career goals involve following illustration and graphic design.
        My grand goal is to one day be able to be part of a production for an
        animated series and to make my own graphic novel series with my
        character designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to use my art as a vehicle to tell stories that explore various
        aspects of our humanity, whether it be the beauty of it or the
        monstrosities that are underneath the facades we live through from day
        to day. I love to draw what I see and take direct inspirations from all
        aspects of life. I often find myself using different fragments of my
        Ecuadorian-American culture where I can because Iâ€™m inspired to share my
        culture with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using digital art, painting, drawing, and animation, I attempt to
        reimagine my own stories through bright colors and bold characters.

        Ecuador for the World (Ecuador Para El Mundo) is a dance group created
        in 2020 by Monica Reyes, Ligia Marca, and Meggan Coronel Marca. The
        group focuses on traditional Ecuadorian dances from all regions of
        Ecuador. During Hispanic Heritage Month, the group performs around New
        London County with the goal of educating the public about the beautiful
